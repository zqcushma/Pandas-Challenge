# Pandas-Challenge
Week 4 Challenge assignment. Take in sample "student" data, analyze, and identify trends. 

IMPORTANT NOTE
Much of the code written follows the exact same format as the given 'hint' code. This is intentional, as that was the requested format.
Due to code being provided as a hint and (supposedly) correct outputs were given in the notebook, those were used to tune my code
and make sure that everything was running properly, so I cannot say that the code is 100% my own original thought. To anyone reading who doesn't
know what I mean, open up the PyCitySchools_starter.ipynb file and look at what was provided (that file remains unchanged), and compare with 
PandasChallengeAnalysis.ipynb, the code I wrote.
